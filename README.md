<strong><code>Backend Developing (Laravel | PHP | MySQL)</code></strong>

<p>I started programming when I was still a schoolboy. 
From an early age I was interested in information technologies and I was always looking for ways to get what I was interested in. 
At first I consumed related content, then I started to have opportunities to realize my potential. 
So, at a more mature age, I took extra computer science classes, then went to college.
Today, I'm an aspiring goal-oriented web developer with experience in building websites.
 
As of July 2023, in addition to front-end, I started to seriously study backend development.
Studied a few courses on Laravel, and now I have an unfinished project in the works, which you can check out in my repos.
I'm currently in my fourth year of college studying web development and am actively seeking commercial experience.
I always strive for self-improvement, so I am ready to learn new technologies and development methods.</p>
